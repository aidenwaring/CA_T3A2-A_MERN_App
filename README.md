### Purpose
Equipped is a peer 2 peer tendering site for people who have unused technology or equipment laying around that they want to rent out in order to make some extra cash.  
How it works
If you want to hire a drone, a vr headset or even both for the weekend, you can send a quote request for the item you want to hire and the timeframe you need it for.  Lets say 3 people in your area have the item your looking for, all three will have the option to name their price and send you a quote once you have received the quotes you can then make an educated decision on who you should rent the equipment from.  The renter will then pay the product owner through the site and the site will take a 5-10% commission. This makes for a more sustainable business model as people are not buying things they are only going to use a few times.
TL;DR  - A user requests a quote, Lenders tender for the quote
